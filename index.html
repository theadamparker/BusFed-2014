                        <p>#BlackLivesMatter. #YesAllWomen. Thomas Piketty’s Capital in the Twenty-First Century. Ta-Nehisi Coates’ The Case for Reparations. From shutting down Interstates to social media uprisings to dense, factual arguments laid out in august journals, 2014 was an historic year for mass social movements.</p>
                        <p>It was also a challenging year. Distrust of partisan politics and changes in the media landscape helped fuel record low turnout in much of the country, especially among young adults, the same people fueling the groundbreaking social movements popping up around the country.</p>
                        <p>The Bus sits at the nexus of this challenge and opportunity. Our newest affiliates -- Chicago Votes, Ohio Student Association, and MOVE San Antonio -- work in far more racially diverse communities than the cities where the Bus originated. The zeitgeist of 2014 among young Americans, our base, demands new kinds of organizing, bolder issue plays, and different kinds of electoral engagement.</p>
                        <p>We’re building an organization capable of these challenges with a lot of help. Even as we build this organization together, I know the core of the Bus will stay the same -- a joyful, playful organization of young people, by young people, and for all people.</p>
                        <p>Thank you for joining us on the journey,</p>

                    <p>24/7. 365. 100%. Which doesn’t just make voter registration rolls big and strong, but straight up revolutionizes participation in those communities.</p>
                    <p>After hella voter registration, the Bus turned up to turn out, making 252,757 phone calls and knocking on 76,983 doors to get out the vote. </p> 
                    <p>And it transforms voter turnout. Most impressively, in Boulder, CO, and Bozeman and Missoula, MT, three towns where we’ve relentlessly engaged young voters in local, city, and state elections since 2010, turnout increased significantly in between mid-terms. In Montana, our two target counties saw an increase of thousands of votes cast (a significant number in a rural state), even as turnout was basically stagnant statewide.</p>

After a lot of research and life experiences (including traveling the world as a youth, college, and semi-pro basketball player) De'Jaun decided to help end that disconnect and became a worker-organizer in the Fight for $15 and Action Now. In 2014, he joined Chicago Votes as a Democracy Organizer, helping the team register over 15,000 young people to vote. After honing his field and management skills, he became Chicago Votes Field Director, leading and mentoring a team of 6 young organizers to bring our youth together and get them informed about the people that make decisions on our lives.</p>

Turns out that someday is now. Three years after meeting the Bus, Chicago Votes has led coalitions to pass Same Day Voter Registration and Online Voter Registration, helped pass ballot measures supporting the minimum wage and an elected school board, registered over 18,000 young people to vote, and grown their staff from 0 to 5 full-time (with a team of 20 during elections). </p>

In barely a year, this multiracial crew of gifted young leaders (nearly all of whom are under 25) built a civic powerhouse. Fresh out of the gate, they gathered hundreds of public comments to pass a citywide LGBTQ non-discrimination ordinance. Then they held the largest campus National Voter Registration Day in America, in back-to-back years. They’ve already registered over 4,500 people to vote and are just getting started.</p>

Their responses to the murders of young black Ohioans John Crawford, Tamir Rice, and Tanisha Anderson brought their work to the (inter)national stage, and their work toward a saner justice system shines a light on how we can build a better, more just nation together.</p>

                    <p>As Congress fumbles around with the politically safest way to do nothing on America’s gun death epidemic, the Washington Bus teamed up with advocates from around the state to do massive voter education and get out the vote and passed a statewide ballot measure to expand background checks for gun safety.</p>
                    <h4>In Oregon...</h4>
                    <p>After inhaling tons of information about Millennial’s opposition to backward, racist drug laws (for reasons ranging from racial and social justice to overall culture shifts), the Oregon Bus Project took to the streets, the doors, and the phones and helped pass a ballot measure to legalize marijuana and upend the trend of young people of color being locked up for tiny amounts weed.</p>

                    <h3>#BlackLivesMatter</h3>
                    <p>In 2014, much of the nation woke up to the chronic oppression and criminalization of black lives in America, from massive economic inequities to the nearly daily deaths of black and brown youth at the hands of police. After the murders of John Crawford, Tamir Rice, and Tanisha Anderson, the Ohio Student Association made national headlines with their passionate and high-profile responses. Now, more Bus affiliates from Texas to Illinois have joined the fight, with ever-louder & more organized demands for increased police accountability and citizen oversight.</p>

                    <h3>Impounding the Carbon</h3>
                    <p>As the planet’s carbon situation gets increasingly dire, the Bus is working aggressively to adopt solutions at the local or state level that can serve as models for the nation. In Oregon and Washington, Bus organizations are working toward carbon pricing plans. In Colorado, we continue to work toward municipalization in Boulder while addressing oil and gas issues and carbon pollution more broadly.</p>

                    <h3>Because, Student Debt</h3>
                    <p>Young Americans inherited the worst economy in decades. Student debt has reached genuine crisis levels, saddling over 40 million Americans with nearly $30,000 of debt a piece. The total amount of student debt now eclipses the total amount of credit card debt. This problem has multiple roots: state governments cutting taxes on wealthy Americans instead of adequately funding higher education, student lenders and processors looking to make big money by pushing bigger loans, and for-profit school administrators who bilk students and taxpayers while laughing all the way to the bank. New Era Colorado, Forward Montana, and Ohio Student Association have been fighting back, through social media narratives, injection of the issue into state and federal electoral contests, and policy development for legislative sessions.</p>
